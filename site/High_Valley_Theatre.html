														THE OJAI FRIDAY
Theater School to Open Here Monday
(By Guido Ferrando)
&#x22;All the world is a stage and all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time, plays many parts . . ..
What Shakespeare say of hu. man life in general, is also true in a narrower sense, and can be applied to our daily existence.
We all act, and are almost always very poor actors; it might profit us to learn how to play our parts better. Joking aside, the opening of the High Valley Theatre Workshop and Dramatic school is a very important event in the life of our beautiful Valley. Ojai is justly proud of its many schools, some of which have a remarkably high stan. dard; it harbours a small, but very active international colony of thinkers, artists, writers, who give it a unique spiritual and artistic atmosphere; and for its fine climate and its wonderful situation, it is well suited to be. come the home of other important cultural institutions. The High Valley Theatre school is one of them; and, if successful, it will bring a powerful contri. bution to the intellectual and artistic life not only of the Val. ley, but of all California.
The aims of the Theatre are: first, to train actors; then, to prepare significant plays, old and new, and send them on tour; and, lastly, to bring the actors back to a home, the workshop, where they may further develop and perfect their work. It is not an easy task that of forming a good actor; it requires a lot of training and a deep understanding. The body must be trained, and this train-ing includes dancing and fencing and the flve Greek gymnas. tics which form a basis for many aspects of dramatic ex. pression. Then the voice must be trained and the pupil must learn the use of speech through a special method of speech formation and eurythmy. Then the imagination must be developed, and at the same time the future actor, to perfect his technique, must study and understand the psychology of human nature.
The school, charmingly locat. ed in the Upper Valley, on the main road to Santa Paula, will open on January 6, and will have full and part time instruc tion courses. It is under the direction of Alan Harkness, who tions &#x22;Cricket on the Hearth,&#x22;
&#x22;Uncle Vanya,&#x22; and the &#x22;Nativ. ity&#x22; (still being performed in the Valley). Mr. Harkness will have as his collaborators Ronald Bennett, a superb actor, also of the Chekhov group, who has had several years experience as a teacher of dramatics and di. rector of plays; Mechtild Johan-nsen, an exquisite singer and musician who has had experi. ence in the different branches of music and the theatre both in Switzerland and in America;
Henry Kersh, a dancer now per forming with Lotte Goslar and company, and a creative artist who has had three years&#x27; teaching experience. Let us hope for the sake of true art and, also, selfishly, for our own personal enjoyment, that this splendid group of actors and teachers will succeed in their arduous task to create a fine dramatic school and train excellent play. ers, thus uplifting the standard of the American prose theatre and enriching our lives by the production of great plays, beautifully acted and admirably staged.

By RONALD D. SCOFIELD The Ojai Players, whe have brought a number of outstand- ing artistic. performances co the Lobero in recent years, came to town last night with a produc tion of Molnar&#x27;s tender, whimsi- cal and tragic legend of a rough- edged ne&#x27;er-do-well named Lili. om, who was undone and saved _by his love for a trusting
young girl. It is a production that has a great deal of artistry, in acting. in scenic and lighting effects and in mood and pace. It is not up to the standard of the best pre- vious work of this group of play. ers. for it is not seasoned and polished and perfected in many details. But it is excellent in con ception, and fine enough in many aspects to indicate that it has the makings of a real work
of theater art.

														GAY CARNIVAL ATMOSPHERE IN MOLNAR PLAY THESE IMPRESSIONS OF the Ojai Players production of Ferenc Molar&#x27;s poignant and colorful play &#x22;Liliom&#x22; were sketched by Don Freeman as the group rehearsed in its High Valley Theater at Ojai for its appearance at the Lobero Saturday and Sunday nights. Featured are the four actors shown in the foreground (from left to right) Iris Tree as Mrs. Muskat, Judson Morgan as Fixeur, Mechthild Johannsen as Julie and Ford Rainey
as biliom.

														TWO ARE SUPERB Two of the women in the cast give superb performances- -Bet tv Harford as Marie. the jittle
country girl who falls in love &#x27;with a porter, and Mechthild Johannsen as Julie, the servant maid who finds the reason for Ilife in the rowdy, proud, lawless carousel barker whose nickhame
is Liliom. While these two dominated the stage, there was magic -even though the lines were those of giggling adolescents, or simple. minded innocents. Miss Harford has something close to sheer ge nius in the artless skill with which she mirrors moods, from tremulous, childish anger, fear, romantic yearning, to prosaic practicality and mature tender- ness. Miss Johannsen has not only fine artistry, but a compel ling presence that gives author ity and meaning to her charac
terization. Ford Rainey is seen in that idle role, and while he conveys st he thing of the warring elemen
Liliom&#x27;s personality, he fally
short of artistic conviction. Somehow he turns the legendary show.off into a sentimentalized nature&#x27;s nobleman who finds himself, surprisingly, garbed in the costume and character of a carnival barker. The fiery, reck- less desperate nature that masked Liliom&#x27;s soft heart and good intentions is not persua
sively suggested.
Iris Tree cast herself as Mrs. Muskat the carousel proprietor who also loved Liliom and schemed to win him back from his childish bride. It is not a very demanding role, but she fills it admirably and convinc
ingly.
MORGAN IN 2 ROLES Judson Morgan is seen in two roles. that of Ficsur, &#x22;the Spar- row,&#x22; who lures Liliom into a tragedy holdup fiasco, and of the Magistrate in the Heavenly Court. Here is where the lack of seasoning is most apparent, for Morgan is capable of superb characterizations and impeccable style. His conception of the rote of Sparrow is excellent, but his dance.like manner of movement needs to be perfected to give a simulation of naturalness, with out loss of the rhythmic feeling he so skillfully conveys. As the Magistrate he was less command- ing. less impressive vocally than
he might have been.
Beverly Benedict as Julie&#x27;s
Aunt, Mother Hollunder:
the photographer, and Ed Preble as Wolf, Marie&#x27;s affianced, gave re. markably fine performances, sen- sitive and convincing. Carl Rag- land as the policeman was rea- sonably adequate, but rather pro. saic in his lines. Raymond Stew. art as Linzman, the intended holdup victim, was entirely ade. quate, if not inspired. The other minor bits were well handled by June Swanson, Anne Evans,
Beatrice Evans, and Judy Evans. The scenic effects, while obvi. ously achieved with the simplest devices, were remarkably effec- tive in dramatic suggestion and pleasing in color and composi
tion. The play will be repeated this evening, and it is well worth the attention of anyone who has a love of the theater. The short comings are those natural to a production that has not had time
to mature in actual performance -not those of inadequate con
ception or poor casting.
