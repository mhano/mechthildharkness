The Irish plays were well done, and were most interesting; but we have seen works of the same writers staged, previously.

First of all, the fine
translation of the sixteen-hundred-years-old work of Kalidasa by Laurence Binyon was a fine achievement.
Then the saturation of the per-
formers and the young musician, Stewart Bur-ton, in the spirit and atmosphere of the story and the beliefs of the time, to such an extent that they were enabled to positively live the characters, and, in the case of Mr.
Dudley,
to interpret the spirit in musical composition, was remarkable.

There was no attempt at
individual effect, each one was intent only to give the spirit of the character, and in every case the delivery of the beautiful lines was impressive in its earnestness and absolute natural-ness, and the enunciation was beautifully clear.
Stewart Dudley had so those who have lived in India declare by some miracle caught the spirit of India in his music, in which he had used the Indian graduation of scale, which are three times as many as we employ.

TE, is gratifying to discover in a ma-
terial age that there are still people willing to listen to a tale of
idyllic love.
Last week there were one or two perceytibly touched by the Live Art Society&#x27;s production at the Playhouse of &#x22;Sakuntala,&#x22; the Indian play which contains no gross thought. no epigram, and never a hint of the
every-day
The Malvern Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Wii. liam J. Mallinson, supplied the music which added considerably to the at mosphere of the play, which was fur- ther benefited by the acting of Alan Harkness as Dushyanta and Beatrice
Touzeau as Sakuntala.
Harkness&#x27;s stage settings also contributed to the
happiness of the aesthetes in the front. During its week at the Playhouse the Live Art Society also did a bracket
of Irish playlets,
&#x22;The Travelling Man&#x22; and &#x22;Spreading the News&#x22; by Lady Gregory, and The Hour Glass&#x22; and &#x22;Cathleen ni Houlihan&#x22; from the
pen of W. B. Yeats.
All of these of. forts are familiar to observers of the operations of the Abbey Theatre, Dub- lin, and there is nothing about them that can be canvassed critically in a
short paragraph.
In contrast to the
comparative knockabout of
&#x22;Spread-
ing the News,&#x27;
&#x22; which has been a fami- ilar Repertory piece in various parts of the world, there were the fantasy
and fairy-tale sweetness of
&#x22;The Travelling Man,&#x22; the poetic wonder. ment of &#x22;The Hour Glass,&#x22; and the
simple Yeatsian Irishness of &#x22;Cathleen
Ani. Houlihan.&#x22; They were all passably well acted
and presented, the party allotted for &#x22;Spreading the News&#x22; showing signs of allowable elation over the oppor tunities offered. Francis D. Wilson was especially good as Bartley Fall lon and Margaret Marshall also did well as Mrs Fallon, Some of tha

														The two peculiar principles of India are the beneficent tie of home life on the one hand, and the liberty of the soul abstracted from the world on the other. In the world India is variously connected with many races and many creeds: she cannot reject any of them. But on the altar of devotion (tapaysa) India sits alone. Kalidasa has shown, both in Sakuntala and Kumara Sambhava, that there is a harmony between these two prin- ciples. an easy transition from the one to the other. In his hermitage a human boy plays with lion cubs, and the hermit
spirit is reconciled with the spirit of the householder.
Sir Rabindranath Tagore In this production the Live Art Society is making its first attempt at the synthesis of the arts which make the art of the theatre. The director, composer and designer have worked in close unity to achieve this end, and it is hoped, with more time, more experience, and more funds, to do significant work
in this direction. With the necessarily limited material at the designer&#x27;s disposal, an attempt has been made to provide simple expressive mis-en-
scene which will help, and not hinder, play and actor. The development of the drama has been kept in mind in the designing of the costumes, and a use of themes, similar to the
music, will be quite noticeable.

														The music, though very interesting in itself, is to be judged
as part of the whole production.
Uner The overture opens with the King&#x27;s love singing theme. given
first in the low register of the orchestra.
This is continued by the higher strings and wood wind to a climax, with a first hint of the curse motive. A bridge passage for strings and
wood wind leads to Sakuntala&#x27;s love singing theme played by the violins: this works up to a repeat of same given in the higher octave by the flutes and oboes. A tremolo passage for strings, with a further hint of the curse motive, is followed by the development of the King&#x27;s theme, working to a full climax of both the King&#x27;s and Sakuntala&#x27;s themes leading straight to
the curse motive at full orchestral strength
A quiet passage for strings, ending with a cadenza for the oboe, is followed by the golden peak theme given by the flute in its highest
register.

														GREAT DRAMA
Would&#x27;st thou the young year&#x27;s blossoms and the
fruits of its decline,
And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured,
fed,
Would&#x27;st thou the Earth and Heaven itself in one
sole name combine?
I name thee, O Sakuntalal and all at once is said.
GoETHE Goethe, the master post of Europe, has summed up his criticism of Sakuntala in a single quatrain; he has not taken the poem to pieces. This quatrain seems to be a small thing like the flame of a candle, but it lights up the whole drama in an instant, and
reveals its inner nature.

															SMHE wonderful poetical quality of
the Indian play,
&#xAB;Sakuntala,&#x22; is
made manifest
the present production by the Live Art Soci- ety at the Playhouse. The mount- ing and setting enhance its subtle
charm, for the effort to
ex- press in color the sentiments of the play has beer done by Alan Hark- ness, with almost Oriental prescience, for color tones and influences have always been a cult with the Occultism of the East. Howard Edie has coached his forces well, and the result is striking performance which has some- how become impregnated with the mystic atmosphere of India, and its
Eastern peoples.
The production of the group of little Irish plays on Thursday night, is looked forward to with interest, as, being so different in character and quality, there is keen. ness to see whether Mr Edie has been as successful in getting the performers to feel the characters, and the story, as they have done in the strong, mys- tic &#x22;Sakuntala,&#x22; with its Indian back-
ground and atmosphere.

Idyll of Old India With Music. Readers of English have long had oppose tunities to be acquainted, in one translation or another, with Kalidasa&#x27;s &#x22;Sakuntala, la classic play of India; and in recent years the idyllic drama has been staged in Eng land. It provided unusual entertainment at the Playhouse last night, when it was produced in an adaptation from Laurence Bieyon&#x27;s version by the Live Art Society, in co-operation with the Malvern Syn-
phony Orchestra.
The music by Mr. Stewart Burton - an overture, interludes, and prelides - was well in accord with the spirit of the play, and was skilfully treated by the orchestra under the direc- tion of Mr. William J. Mallinson, Sym- bolic use was made of the stage settings, designed by Mr. Alan Harkness, and of the lighting. The stors was followed with much interest, from the early scenes in the saered grove through the time of melancholy to the reunion of the lovers. Sakuntala (Mies

Oriental gongs sounded; and voices of unseen people floated across a darkened room at the first night of the Ab Intra Studio season

the 80-minute programme. Ab Intra means &#x22;From within,&#x22; and the Ab Intra plavers seek to portray drama. poetry, and other art from within them

The studio is not 12 months old yet, but its members have already at-
tracted much inteest in Adelaide. Duing her visit here Dame Sybil Thorn- dike saw some of their work at the studio, which is a lage upstairs room in King
William street south. The first half of the programme was de voted mainly to &#x22;The Sisters,&#x22; a little- known play by Gordon Bottomly, an Eng-
lish poet and dramatist. Effective interpretations of several of Kester Baruch&#x27;s strikingly original poems were given by Alan Harkness in the
second&#x22; half.
Two of the poems were
represented in shadow zraphs.

The acting was excellent, and the illusion given of mounting a horse and cantering off was quite

In the Three Cradle Songs the staging con- sisted of a background of rice-paper windows against which a few bamboos were swaying. and the light behind the windows was a gorgeous green with
blue or yellow suns in the centre. Every &#x22;phase&#x22; was distinct in char- acter from each other and particularly beautiful was Ritual of Sleep and Awakening the stage effects being very fine, an autumn tree from- which the bright, leaves detached themselves and floated to the floor was a marvel of stagecraft. and so also were the lights that flickered in and out on the robe

Japan but in it.

by Alan Harkness. Poems illustrated in silhouette were most charming. Just a white screen, with the light behind it and the
character or characters acting in front.
The effect was marvellous.
Kester Baruch gave one of these poems while
the acting was going on.
Kester Baruch&#x27;s gift for poetry is a play or beautiful imagination woven into form
by colorful words
His description of a drive near Port Augusta, where he received, his inspiration to write &#x22;San-
dalwood Tree,&#x22; was charming.
One could see it all--the red-hot dust swirled by &#x22;willy-willies,&#x22; like a red ribbon up to the hard blue sky, and
the bare, gnarled sandalwood The tremendous suffering of them and the tremendous sweetness of their per- fume was the theme of his poem, and his aim was that the audience should
be left with the idea,
&#x22;what sweet-
ness.&#x22; The second part of the evening was
filled with a play called
&#x22;The Two
Sisters.&#x22; by Gordon Bottomley.
Just two women in it (Phyllis Drummond
and Thelma Thomas).
A bed with a blue coverlet, a screen, and a shaft of light across the faces of the two

was quite wonderful,
When it began;
one shrank a little with the thought.
&#x22;Oh! THAT sort of thing!&#x22;
But as the play beautifully unfolded, one found it was by no means &#x22;that sort of thing.&#x22; but a little play of sheer beauty and exceedingly well done by
the two players. One soon realised that what these young people are alming at is the simple, sineere, and natural in the world of the theatre. and one found

Performance The first performance of members of the Abintra Studio was presented last
night and scored a distinct success. The programme consisted of a collec- tion of the best plays the Studio has done with the addition of a Russian
play

done in the Russian &#x22;grand
manner&#x22; with vodka, pistols, and vivid tempers convincingly played by, Iris Thomas,

Delightful was the presentation of &#x22;Sister Helen&#x22; by Dante Gabriel Ros- setti, in which the players were all women_-Iris Thomas, Marjorie Fran- cis, Peggy Brown, Janet Cleland, and Lorraine Angus- -who gave a striking
performance.
Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &#x22;The Flight Into Egypt,&#x22; done by Agnes Dobson, Lucy willoughby, and Kester Baruch, was
excellently played. The staging and lighting effects were something quite out of the ordinary and added greatly to the effectiveness
of the whole. The performances will be given again tonight, on Saturday, and
Christmas night.

race, for March Ist and 2nd. So much enthusiasm was evinced at the meeting by members present that all tickets for the two perfor- mances were sold out, and it is likely

Present Plans They will leave by an Italan ship, disembark at Crenod, and on bicycles make for France; follow the course of the Rhone, have a look at Paris, go
to Havre and land at Southampton. They hope then to get some experience at the Dartington school at Totness in Devonshire, under Kurt Joold, who has been highly written of by Jacques
Copeau in Paris.
This is what they are aiming at, but, of course, is liable
to alteration. Mrs. Bonython addressed the meet- ing, and touched on the fact that these exceptionally brilliant young
men&#x22; needed a wider experience,
&#x22;Ade- laide being a back-water in theatrical affairs. There is nothing here to learn
from.&#x22; Alan Harkness followed on and out- lined their plans as far as they knew
them at present.
Practical Gratitude

Their perfoirmance of
Sullvan and the Eagle stands alone. In London I saw Martine with Vic- toria Hopper giving a beautiful per- formance, but Martine, as done by The Ab Intra Studio, compares most fav-

is the best form of gratitude.
Mrs.

The Lost Poet
He was born to stir the spirit of his race
to tears and langhter. He was born to be the writer and the
singer of his age,
For he had the gift in keeping. and the
generations after Should have held his name, the
Deathless, as a glorious heritage. His the gift of Dream and Wonder, his
to see with clearer vision, Through the old pretence and fashion to the heart of Hidden Things, But his people stood before him, and
they marred the gift&#x27;s fruition As they spoke to him of madness,
that such dreaming ever brings. They had words to crush the yearning of the high, ambitious spirits, And they held this spirit downward as
it struggled to the light.
And they whispered to each other, wris
the madness he inherits From the father and the mother; let
us suide his steps aright!&#x22; Then he woke as if from slumber, but the starry path was hidden, And the spirit world was shrouded,
and he sought its light in vain.
And the gift of song went from him. as
it came to him unbidden, He had turned to meaner worship, and
he might not sing aeain
So he wandered forth, a rover, and the
dark and silent spaces
Never knew the sound of singing, by
its magic lay uncrossed; But the wrong went ap to Heaven, and the angels bowed their faces, And the stars were veiled and hidden,
for the poet that was lost.

														Chosen by Chekhov_ The many mem- bers who so loyally supported Kester Baruch and Alan Harkness in their ideal of the Ab-intra Studio, will be delighted to hear that these two clever Adelaide young men have been chosen by Michael Chekhoy to join the group he intends to train for three years at the Chekhov Theatre Studio, and then bring them before the world, backed by the seemingly unlimited resources of the marvellous Dartington Hall Estate in Totness, Devon, England. Michael Chekhov, a nephew of the great drama. tist, Anton Chekhov, is considered by

He received his training under Stanislovsky, of the Moscow Art Theatre, and later filled a very important administrative position

Chekhov works from within. and in his training makes it clear that the externalising that an actor is called upon to do is inseparable from an in- ner attitude, that is, if it is to be crea-
tive and convincing. Two Australians. Needless to say Kester Baruch and Alan Harkness felt it an unique honor to be the only two Australians to be chosen by Chekhov to work in his studio, There are one New Zealander, one or two Canadians, one German, one Norwegian, several Ame. ricans. and among the men only two Englishmen. Before being selected they had to undergo a test lasting over four
hours. Fortunately, they found some of the things they had to do quite easy. because of their own experiments in the same direction, and also because
of the work they did with Heather Gell. They are now in surroundings of sheer beauty; their studios and their bed. rooms opening on to wonderful gar-
dens, are beautiful.
Even so are the food and the manner in which it is served. Chekhov tells them that they must neved forget for one moment that they are artists, that they are young, strong and beautiful. They may not be so outside. but that is not nearly so important as being so inside, and that must be their attitude to all they do even the simplest things, such as shifting a chair, drawing the curtains,
or closing a door.
