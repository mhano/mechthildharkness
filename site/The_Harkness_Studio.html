													</font>
													<font face="Courier New" size="2">
														<font face="Arial">The introduction of Rudolf Steiner&#39;s
															Speech Formation, Dramatic Art and Eurythmy in Australia was
															the work of Alice Crowther. Although dramatic performances
															under the guidance of Marian Burley Griffin and Lute
															Drummond had been a feature of Anthroposophical work at the
															Open Air Theatre at Castle Crag for a number of years, Alice
															Crowther was the first teacher with a Dornach training to
															establish a Studio in Sydney. Many professional actors came
															to her and she gave a firm foundation to the first teachers
															in Rudolf Steiner education and curative education.
															<br><br>Upon learning of Steiner&#39;s work, Alice Crowther
															set off in the nineteen thirties to train in Speech
															Formation and Eurythmy at Dornach, intending to bring the
															work back to Australia. In Dornach she was one of the first
															group of English speaking people to train in Speech
															Formation and to work on framing English equivalents for
															Rudolf Steiner&#39;s speech exercises. At the Goetheanum she
															was able to take part in rehearsals and classes with Marie
															Steiner. She continued her speech work with Erna Grund and
															her Eurythmy work with Friedel Thomas.<br><br>Alice
															Crowther&#39;s intention to return to Australia after her
															training was diverted by a stroke of destiny. In 1936,
															Michael Chekhov, the Russian actor and director came to
															England to form a theatre company. He had known Rudolf
															Steiner before the first world war and found that his
															indications for the actor could extend and enliven what he
															himself had developed as a pioneer of new impulses of
															theatre under the direction of Constantin Stanislavsky and
															Gordon Craig in Russia, and had used this attitude to
															theatre in the Second Moscow Art Theatre. Alice Crowther was
															recommended to him as a speech teacher. From 1936 to 1941
															they worked together in England and later in the United
															States. Another Australian working as a colleague with
															Michael Chekhov was Alan Harkness who had pioneered and
															artistic experimental theatre studio - the Ab Intra Studio
															with Kester Baruch, who had joined the Chekhov Studio as a
															writer.<br><br>Michael Chekhov gave his students a deep
															feeling of reverence towards the theatre and the actor&#39;s
															vocation. He made them aware of the origin of theatre in the
															mysteries and the function through tragedy and comedy of
															leading people to self awareness. When the students came to
															rehearse, they changed to a special rehearsal dress, so that
															one put aside personal interests and was concentrated on the
															work to be created together. The students worked on acting
															exercises given by Constantin Stanislavsky with the added
															dimension of an Anthroposophical training in concentration
															and perception. When a play was to be prepared, the main
															episodes and climaxes were improvised again and again before
															the actual text of the play was taken up. When the actors
															had their parts, each student had an individual private
															session with Alice Crowther to achieve in speech technique
															the qualities Michael Chekhov as director wanted brought
															through. Regular speech and eurythmy classes with Alice
															Crowther, as well as modern dance, gymnastics and music with
															other teachers were the basic training.<br><br>After the
															Munich crisis of 1938, the Chekhov Theatre Studio moved to
															the United States and opened their first professional season
															in New York with an adaptation of Dostoyevsky&#39;s <i>The
																Possessed</i>. Michael Chekhov chose this theme because
															he wanted to show the Western world what takes place when
															people give themselves over to destructive nihilistic
															forces. It came out of his own experience of living through
															the years of the Russian Revolution. The Theatre Studio
															toured as a repertoire of plays until the United States
															entered the war. In 1941 the Studio was disbanded. Michael
															Chekhov came to work in Hollywood. Alan and Mechthild
															Harkness and others carried the Studio way of working
															further in California.<br><br>It was then that Alice
															Crowther came to Sydney and established the Studio in
															Hamilton Street. Many and varied productions were performed
															between the years of 1941 and 1954 when the Studio was
															finally disbanded. From this time however, until her death
															in 1967, Alice Crowther continued to give speech and
															eurythmy classes at her house in Roseville. Her students
															were eventually to carry her work forward into the sphere of
															education. (Dennis Glenny)<br><br>

															<font size="3"><br></font>During the last year of her life
															Alice Crowther wrote to Mechthild Harkness and expressed how
															pleased she was that Mechthild was working so creatively
															with the art of formative speech in the English language -
															the realm of her own work. When Mechthild heard of
															Alice&#39;s death in 1967 she saw the possibility of coming
															to Australia to carry on some of Alice&#39;s work here. It
															had always been the intention of Mechthild and her late
															husband, Alan Harkness, to return to Australia bringing the
															fruits of their experience gained over many years of
															teaching, performing and producing in Europe and America.
															Two years later Mechthild arrived in
															Sydney.<br><br>Mechthild was surrounded by artistic activity
															from her earliest years, participating in performances even
															as a very young child. Her mother, Lucy Neuscheller, was one
															of the very early Eurythmists under Rudolf Steiner and
															brought the art of Eurythmy to the U.S.A. In her youth
															Mechthild attended a number of drama schools and trained in
															Opera. The family returned to Dornach for a few years where
															Mechthild first met Alice Crowther who was then doing her
															speech training with Erna Grund and her Eurythmy training
															with Friedel Thomas. Back in New York, Mechthild trained in
															Eurythmy and met her Australian husband, Alan Harkness, who
															was then working with the Chekhov Theatre Studio. When the
															Chekhov Studio disbanded, Alan went to California where
															Mechthild joined him. In 1949-51 she and Alan toured Europe
															and America with their duo performance of <i>Great Moments
																from Shakespeare </i>and spent time studying with Erna
															Grund in Dornach. They returned to America where Alan was
															tragically killed in 1952. In 1954 Mechthild returned to
															Dornach and received her Diploma in formative speech,
															graduating in the same year as Virginia Brett. She remained
															in Dornach for the next twelve years, teaching, performing
															and producing. In 1967 Francis Edmunds asked her to set up a
															Speech and Drama Department at Emerson College where she
															worked for the two years prior to her arrival in
															Australia.<br><br>In July 1969, the first classes commenced
															in Sydney with Mechthild teaching Speech, Eurythmy, Greek
															Gymnastics, Improvisation and Drama. Marj Waugh, who had
															been carrying the Eurythmy work after her many years with
															Alice Crowther, and Doug Waugh, connected with the early
															drama work of Lute Drummond, came along to give their
															blessing. A much appreciated and continuing support has come
															from an early student, Garry Richardson. Among the first
															students were Alan and Susan Whitehead, Eva Fieck, Dennis
															Glenny, Ruth Marx, Annika Jaensch (Benson), Ian and Mark
															Scrivener, Graham Dixon, Thomas Ludescher and Pat Brett. The
															early classes were held at Inala School and then at
															Thornleigh. Performances were offered as part of the
															Society&#39;s festival celebrations and workshop
															demonstrations were given at some of the schools.<br><br>In
															1970 the Studio was officially formed and named Boama - Man
															in Art. A home for the new Studio was found in Chatswood
															where, in addition to Mechthild&#39;s classes, Ruth
															Ainsworth taught History of Art, Thomas Ludescher - Bothmer
															Gym and Marj Waugh - Eurythmy. The Studio gave a performance
															of Scenes 4, 5 and 6 of <i>The Portal of Initiation.</i>
															This was the first time any of Rudolf Steiner&#39;s Mystery
															Dramas had actually been staged in Australia.<br><br>The
															Creative Speech work has also left its mark in the realm of
															professional theatre in Australia. At the request of Robin
															Lovejoy, Mechthild became voice coach for the Old Tote
															Theatre and continued in this work for four years until
															Robin Lovejoy resigned as artistic director. John Bell, Ruth
															Cracknell, Drew Forsythe, John Gaden, Rod Haddrick, Ron
															Falk, Damien Parker, Dinah Shearing and many others were
															among the actors who worked with Mechthild during this time,
															and some later returned for private tuition.<br><br>As the
															Studio work grew, classes were given at Warrah and Inala,
															some of which were given by the more advanced students such
															as Annika. Mechthild herself was also busy again preparing
															for her inspired solo performance of Sophocles&#39;
															<i>Antigone</i>, which she performed in Sydney and
															Melbourne.<br><br>In 1973 the Studio moved to Willoughby and
															was renamed The Harkness Studio, thus associating it with
															Alan Harkness who pioneered the very beginnings of
															experimental theatre in Australia. Work continued at
															Willoughby and later at Cremorne supported by Dennis Glenny
															(improvisation and drama), Graham Dixon (drama) and Robin
															Labron-Johnson (Speech, Drama and Greek Gymnastics). Both of
															the latter completed their diplomas with Mechthild. Avril
															Drew taught Eurythmy at this time. In June 1979 the Studio
															moved to its present premises in Manly.<br><br>1980 was a
															very full year with three major dramatic productions. There
															was an anthroposophical seminar at Mittagong in May, the
															theme of which was <i>Man as a Threefold Being Active in
																Science and Art</i>. The Studio spent the first term
															preparing a series of scenes from Rudolf Steiner&#39;s
															Mystery Dramas relating to the theme of the conference. The
															scenes were performed in Sydney and then at Mittagong. The
															second and third term were spent preparing a full programme
															with chorus work and scenes from Sophocles&#39;
															<i>Antigone</i>.<br><br>As the years have gone by the school
															has grown and consolidated. Originally and for many years
															the bulk of the teaching of Speech, Drama, Eurythmy and
															Gymnastics as well as all of the administration was carried
															by Mechthild. Now some of those who have been her students
															in the past have returned to teach beside her.
															Mechthild&#39;s health has been poor this year but
															fortunately there is now a strong team of teachers working
															with her who are able to carry the work. Mechthild is at
															present teaching students in the final year of the training
															and taking the Speech chorus work which prepared a
															production of Steven Moore&#39;s play <i>The Star and the
																Branch</i>, performed at a seminar at Mittagong in
															September.<br><br>In 1981 the school has 18 students spread
															over the four years of training. Apart from Australia
															students have come from the U.S.A. (3), South Africa (1),
															Canada (1), England (1), Switzerland (1) and New Zealand
															(3). The school is the only school working with Rudolf
															Steiner&#39;s formative speech and dramatic indications in
															English, which teaches drama as well as speech. When
															Virginia Brett closed her English speech school in Dornach
															at Easter this year, several of the students came to
															continue their training here.<br><br>Students who complete
															the course receive a Diploma in affiliation with the Section
															for Speaking and Musical Arts at the Goetheanum School for
															Spiritual Science. Students do the course for a variety of
															reasons. Some want to work in professional theatre, some do
															the therapeutic work or teaching and others for their own
															development.<br><br>In 1980, the Harkness Studio became a
															non-profit company and is now entering a new phase of its
															life as a registered charity with supporting membership. In
															July this year, members and friends were invited to a
															workshop performance of Steven Moore&#39;s play, <i>The Star
																and the Branch</i>, followed by a meeting, to discuss
															the possibilities of fund raising. Apart from the rent, all
															running costs and wages must be met by students&#39; fees.
															These are at present inadequate to afford the teachers a
															living wage. The logical solution would be to raise the
															fees, but the students receive no financial assistance from
															the Government, and hence must work to support themselves
															and their study. Last year, a scholarship fund was
															initiated, and at present lends money on a monthly basis
															enabling students to pay fees on time. It is hoped that this
															will expand to carry students, at least through their final
															year, by way of loans repayable after completion of the
															training. A nucleus of friends is emerging as a support
															group, to raise funds to cover expanding needs of the
															Studio. We are now faced with the task of presenting this
															work to a wider community, and inviting support from those
															who recognise the need for a drama with spiritual content,
															and a technique capable of bringing that content to life.
															The Harkness Studio continues to further the speech and
															drama impulse first brought to Australia by Alice Crowther,
															and strives to strengthen and carry that impulse into the
															future.
