Up hoo-2/1936
At Chekhov&#x27;s Studio Writing from the Chek- hov Theatre Studio, Ren-
worth House, Totness,
Devon,
England, Kester Baruch sends news that one feels sure will be much en- joyed by all members of the Ab-Intra studio which he
and Alan Harkness created. The letter begins with a trip to Vienna because, as he explains: &#x22;I have just returned

Totness. Devon.
The Inner Attitude
Chekhov works in
that Kester Baruch and Alan Harkness felt was the only way when they named
their studio Ab-intra.
He works from the within and in his training makes
it clear that all the

in- separable from an inner attitude, that
is, if it is to be creative and convincing. The persons in the group have been drawn from all corners of the world- two Australlans (Kester and Alan), one New Zealander, one or two Canadians, one German, one Norwegian, several Americans, and among the men only
two Englishmen.
Surrounded By Beauty So there they are embarked on. a career that may make history in the
world of the theatre.
Kester writes: &#x22;We are surrounded by beauty, work- ing in beautiful studios, sleeping in beautiful rooms, opening on to beauti- ful gardens, fed with beautiful food
served in a beautiful manner. Chekhov says that while we are here we must not forget for one moment that we are artists, that we are young, strong, and
beautiful.
We may not be so outside, but that is not nearly so important as
being so
Inside, tor unal must be our attitude to all we do even the simplest thing. such as shifting a chair, draw-

														THE PLAYBILL
WHO&#x27;S WHO
It is the policy of the Chekhov Theatre Players not to star or feature any one performer because of their desire to have the company recognized and judged as an entity in itself. They believe that, important though the individual performance is, ensemble acting is the highest development of theatrical art.

MICHAEL CHEKHOV, the company&#x27;s mentor and director, is a nephew of Anton Chek-hov, the playwright. He was a member of the acting company of the world-renowned Moscow Art Theatre, under the leadership of Stanislavsky and Nemirovitch-Dantchenko.
He was director of the Second Moscow Art Theatre, and has played and directed in many languages and as many countries. Although this is the first time he has directed
&#x22;Twelfth Night&#x22; in its original language, he is credited with four previous productions of the play in three different languages and in different stagings.
In 1936, under the pa-
tronage of Mr. and Mrs. Leonard K. Elmhirst, he founded the Chekhov Theatre Studio at Dartington Hall, Devonshire, England. World developments made it necessary to move the studio to Ridgefield, Conn., in 1939, where it now functions.
GEORGE
_SHDANOFF, co-director of
&#x22;Twelfth Night,&#x22; received his early training as an actor in Russia. Subsequently he played in German in the leading theatres of Berlin. He also directed, acted and wrote for the stage and screen in Paris and London.
His original plays and adaptations enjoyed long runs in various European capitals. He was a member of Chekhov&#x27;s staff at Dar-tington Hall and continues to work with his compatriot at the Studio in Ridgefield.
JOSEPH WOOD, who composed the music for &#x22;Twelfth Night,&#x22; majored in music at Bucknell University.
He studied piano un-
der Carl Roeder at the Institute of Musical Art, and from 1936 to 1940 held a fellowship at the Juilliard Foundation in composition, studying with Bernard Wagenaar.
A sym-
phony written by Mr. Wood in 1939 has been performed both here and abroad.
BEATRICE STRAIGHT (Viola) was delegated Chekhov&#x27;s authority and the responsibilities of director during the Players&#x27; recent road tours.
Daughter of Mrs.
Leonard
K. Elmhirst, Miss Straight studied for a year with Madame Ouspenskaya and Madame

Daykarhanova in New York and attended a summer term at the Cornish School in Se-attle.
Graduating from the Chekhov Theatre Studio in 1939, she founded the professional Chekhov Theatre Players.
FORD RAINEY (Sir Toby Belch) attended the Cornish School in Seattle. He was a member of the American Repertory Theatre in New York and on tour, worked as a marionette manipulator and actor with Sue Has-tings&#x27; Marionettes, and is fencing master at the Chekhov Studio.
RONALD BENNETT (Sebastian)
attended
Brown University, Providence, R. I., and has appeared professionally on Broadway in sev eral television broadcasts.
SAM SCHATZ (Malvolio) calls the University of California his Alma Mater. He appeared in several productions of the Little Theatre at Berkeley before joining the Chekhov Theatre Studio at Dartington Hall.
JOHN FLYNN (Orsino) became interested in the drama at the University of Virginia. He appeared with Ethel Barrymore in The Constant Wife,&#x22; and has been seen in various plays on tour.
MARY HAYNSWORTH (Maria) was President of the Masquers Dramatic Club at Winthrop College. She earned a B.A, degree at the University of North Carolina, appeared in the Paul Green&#x27;s play at the Texas Centennial and later acted in the same author&#x27;s &#x22;The Lost Colony.&#x22; Several other summer theatre engagements followed. She has studied dancing with the Jooss Ballet and the Martha Graham Group.
HURD HATFIELD (Sir Andrew Aguecheek) majored in dramatics at Bard College, New York. He won a scholarship to the Chekhov Theatre Studio at Dartington Hall, England, and has been identified with the Chekhov Theatre Players since.

WHO&#x27;S WHO IN THE CAST
(Continued)
ALAN HARKNESS (Feste), a native of Aus-tralia, won a scholarship for painting at the age of sixteen at the National Gallery, Mel-bourne, Australia. He toured Australia for two years in repertory and later formed the
&#x22;Abintra Theatre Studio&#x22; for experimental productions in Adelaide, Australia. He acted in the London production of &#x22;Lady Precious Stream&#x22; and left to join the Chekhov Theatre Studio at Dartington Hall. Now a member of the Studio&#x27;s teaching staff, he recently assisted Mr. Chekhov in directing &#x22;King Lear.&#x22;
MARY LOU TAYLOR (Olivia) was active in dramaties at Bennington College, and worked with producing groups at the Playhouse in Cleveland, the University of North Carolina, the King-Smith Studio in Washington, D. C., and for two seasons with the summer theatre at Williamstown, Mass.
YOUL BRYNER (Fabian) was born in the Far East. At the age of twelve he was sent to school in France. He studied singing in Paris and joined one of the leading theatres there. He left France when the war started and came to the United States.
NELSON HARRELL (Curio) received his B.A. degree from Baylor University in drama-English. Performed at Baylor University Theatre and the Civic Theatre. He has worked on radio, sung with leading dance bands, and did a stint as reporter on the New Orleans &#x22;Times Picayune.&#x22;
LESTER BACHARACH (Valentine) graduated from Brown University. Was a member of the Woodstock Playhouse, Woodstock, N. Y., where he played with Elissa Land in one of the productions. He has been heard often on the radio in a variety of programs.

THE PLAY BILL
THE CHEKHOV THEATRE
PLAYERS
THE Chekhov Theatre Players were her
ganized in the summer of 1940. They are young actors from all parts of the United States, with a member from Australia, England and the Far East.
In banding together under the name and guidance of Michael Chekhov of Moscow Art fame, their belief was that a group, or ensemble theatre, offered the greatest opportunity for developing their craft.
For many months they studied and rehearsed together at the Chekhov Theatre Studio in Ridgefield, Conn., becoming a company in spirit as well as in name. In the Fall of 1940 a series of road bookings was arranged and the young actors were sent out to prove their mettle.
This tour of &#x22;Twelfth Night&#x22; and &#x22;The Cricket on the Hearth,&#x22; which covered 15 states, from Massachusetts and New Hamp-shire in the North to Texas and Oklahoma in the South, proved successful in every way.
They went into territory seldom, and in some cases never before, traversed by professional players. The close bookings in divers and remote parts of the various states made travel by railroad impractical. Instead, three station wagons, driven by members of the troupe, were used and a truck for lights, props, costumes and scenery.
It was an exciting life, with many adven-tures, to say nothing of the handicaps in assembling the shows in auditoriums and buildings ill-equipped for professional stage productions. But the enthusiasm of their audiences and the realization that they were bringing theatre to thousands of Americans, some of whom had never seen a stage production before, prompted them to tour again this autumn, adding another play, &#x22;King Lear,&#x22; to their repertoire.
Needless to say, Michael Chekhov was gratified by the achievements of his com-pany. And the Chekhov Theatre Players themselves, through their success on tour, found the necessary courage to brash it out in sock and buskin for the honors of the Broadway field.
The tenure of the company on Broadway, however, will be limited because of bookings which start in the middle of January in Florida and continue through until April, taking in new territory in Texas, Oklahoma and up through the Middle Western States.

A PROMISE FULFILLED This promise, made in 1936, was first fulfilled by the Chekhov Theatre Players&#x27; appearance on Broadway in 1939,
and then by their extensive tour of the country in 1940.
CHEKHOV THEATRE PLAYERS By the unprecedented success of their 1940 tour the Chekhov Theatre Players have proved that &#x22;the road&#x22; is eager to see good theatre and that a group of enthusiastic young American actors, designers, musicians and technicians- the outgrowth of intensive training in the Chekhov Theatre Studio
can meet that need with thorough professional mastery.
UNDER MASTERLY DIRECTION The directing genius of this young American acting com pany is Michael Chekhov, nephew of the great playwright, Anton Chekhov: actor member of the world&#x27;s foremost stage, the Moscow Art Theatre; one of the director founders of its celebrated First Studio; and sole director of the Second Moscow Art Theatre for five years. Leaving Moscow in 1928, he worked in Riga, Paris, Vienna and Prague and brought his own company to New York in 1935. As a result of that
fortunate visit the Chekhov. Theatre Studio was founded.
BRING A REPERTORY OF GREAT PLAYS For their 1941 tour the Chekhov Theatre Players have selected a brilliant and varied repertory. Because of the tre
mendous success of Shakespeare&#x27;s &#x22;Twelfth Night&#x22; and Dickens &#x22;The Cricket on the Hearth&#x22; throughout the 1940 tour, these will be shown again. Another great Shakespearean play will
be added, and a fantasy for children. Of Shakespeare&#x27;s gayest and most heart warming comedy, Walter Hampden, the eminent American actor says: &#x22;I never enjoyed Twelfth Night&#x27; as much as I did the other night at
the Chekhov Theatre Studio. It was original and delightful.&#x22;*

														THEATRE PLAYERS a school for the theatre and a theatre itself. Its aims were to
lual gifts; to form a group and to provide such a group with a While of an earlier production by Michael Chekhov of the same play. Sean O&#x27;Casey, the great Irish playwright said: &#x22;It bewildered me with its joy, rhythm, color and loveliness. This is Shakespearean Comedy at last! This is the big heart of the poet. Here is the production in which the audience can laugh with Shakespeare, dance with Shakespeare, and sigh with
Shakespeare. The Cricket on the Hearth&#x22; by Charles Dickens was dramatized almost as soon as the novel was published in 1845, and has ever since proved a great favorite with American au diences and leading actors of the stage -Joseph Jefferson having
created one of his most celebrated roles as Caleb Plummer. The adaptation used by the Chekhov Theatre Players has been made by Michael Chekhov, and to the present production of the charming tale he has brought a wealth of insight, creating
a performance which touches the hearts of both young and old. A desire to give pleasure to children and to encourage the theatre audience of the future has actuated the Chekhov The atre Players in their choice of &#x22;Troublemaker Doublemaker.&#x22; This fantasy, which will delight children of all ages, is based on fairy tale themes of the great Austrian writer, Ferdinand Reimund, and has been adapted and given a setting in the south western part of the United States. The play has been written by Michael Chekhov and Iris Tree, daughter of Sir Beerbohm Tree, the celebrated English actor. Humorous and yet profound, it deals with the adventures that befall a man
who is a tyrant to his family and servants. How he is, made to &#x22;see himself as others see him,&#x22; and how his heart is changed,
is depicted in a series of amusing and fanciful scenes. Because of the great demand for Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, it has been decided to draw once more on that inexhaustible source and produce one of his dramas. The timeless quality and universal appeal of the greatest of all dramatic writers
makes this choice a fortunate one for the present time.

Robert Coleman in the New York Mierer &#x22;It was interesting to watch them thrown back to such an extent on make-up, technical pains and high spirits, never minding the logic of any prose in life. This conception of the play is the only conception and approach that can set
free such a piece of art as &#x27;Twelfth Night.&#x22;
-stark Young in the New Reouble Albany has been host to most of the great names in the legitimate theatre, but we can say without equivocation that the performance last night, for sheer artistry and
finished work has never been surpassed.
Edgar S. Yan Olindo In the Albony Times Union the magic never weakened and the audience&#x27;s en thusiasm never waned. The Chekhov Players presented Twelfth Night with a joyous and vibrant theatricality that reminds a twentieth century audience at the same time of the Ballet Russe and Walt Disney&#x27;s cartoons Twelfth Night&#x27; is not life, makes no pretense of being life. Nor was the production in any sense ARTY; it
was ART. If this be theatre, then give me more of it . .. Shakespeare, we know by seeing, is master of revels to mankind; and the Chekhov Players are his consanguine
revellers.&#x27;

-The Manchester Union, N. H. With the superb make-up and settings which are funda- mental to Mr. Chekhov&#x27;s system, &#x27;The Cricket&#x27; was visual ly realistic as a succession of old English prints.

The
Studio sLOUD invaded
Broadway last season with &#x22;The Possessed&#x22; tor a two weeks&#x27; run.
Chekhov them decided that his players needed another season or of preparation before they
were ready for Broadway.
