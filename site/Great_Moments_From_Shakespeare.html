														5 Scene
R&#x26;J
Parting Enter Romeo and JuLieT, above, at the window.]
jULIet. Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. ROMEO. It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: Night&#x27;s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops: I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
jULIET. Yond light is not day-light, I know it, I: It is some meteor that the sun exhales, To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet; thou need&#x27;st not to be gone.
ROMEO. Let me be ta&#x27;en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I&#x27;ll say yon gray is not the morning&#x27;s eyd,
&#x27;Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia&#x27;s brow; Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. How is&#x27;t, my soul? let&#x27;s talk: it is not day.
jULIET. It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away! It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
O, now I would they had changed voices too! Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunts-up to the day.
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
ROMEO. More light and light: more dark and dark our woes!
Enter nuRse, to the chamber. NURSE. Madam!
jULIET. Nurse?
NURSE. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber: The day is broke; be wary, look about.
jULIET. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
[Exit.
ROMEO. Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I&#x27;ll descend.
[Descends.
JULIET. Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend! I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!
ROMEO. Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
JULIET. O, think&#x27;st thou we shall ever meet again? ROMEO. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
JULIET. O God! I have an ill-divining soul.
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails or thou look&#x27;st pale.
ROMEO. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
[Exit.
JULIET. O fortune, fortunel all men call thee fickle: If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
That is renown&#x27;d for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For then. I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,

														King Lear Lear, aged King of Britain, would relinquish his rule and
apportion the Kingdom to his three daughters.
Scene 1:
&#x22;Which of you ... doth love us most ..
&#xBB; The court assembles around the map of the Kingdom. Lear proclaims that the devotion shall depend upon the degree of filial devotion each daughter tenders him. Goneril, wife of Albany, and Regan, wife of Cornwall, falsely profess their affections while Cordelia, at first incapable of speech, finally utters her devotion in terse phrases which could bring Lear to his senses. Instead he falls into a blind rage and disinherits her: The King of France, recognizing her worth, joyfully claims her as his bride while Regan and Goneril plot togethet how they will subjugate their willfull father
who is to reside with each of them alternately.
Scene 2:
&#x22;Lear&#x27;s shadow ...
Returning from the hunt, Lear finds himself unattended. His Fool makes bitter jokes about the folly of old men who should have acquired wisdom with age. Lear curses Goneril
who scornfully deprives hith of half his train.
Scene 3:
&#x22;1 did her wrong ..
Lear and his Fool journey to Regan.
Scene 4:
&#x22;No, you unnatural hags.
Regan and Goneril demand that Lear dismiss his entire train. Lear prefers exposure to the oncoming storm to being har betired by such daugliters: Regan and Goneril shut the doors
against the storm.

Scene 5:
&#x22;Blow winds, and crack your cheeks. Accompanied by his Fool, Lear challenges the raging elements to destroy ingrateful man. In the struggle to under- stand human nature he loses his mind. He prays and sleeps,
watched over by the Fool.
INTERMISSION 10 MINUTES
Scene 6:
&#x22;In your own Kingdom.&#x22;
Cordelia rescues her father who regains his senses in her tent.
Scene 7:
&#x22;Come, let&#x27;s away to prison. Goneril and Regan, having ruthlessly subjugated everyone standing in their way to supreme power, now fear that Lear and Cordelia will arouse the sympathy and support of the
people. They order them to be captured and taken to prison.

Cordelia has been hanged - Lear dies.

Or at their chamber-door I&#x27;L beat the drum
Till it cry steep to death.
Regan. Iam glad to see your highness. Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason O I have to think so: If thou shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother&#x27;s tomb,
Sepulchring an adultress
Regan. I pray you, sir, take patierce:
LEAR:

Sharp-tooth&#x27;d unkindness, like a vulture, here:

With how depraved a quality--O Regan!
REGaN

You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty.
Lear.
Say, how is that? Regan. I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
She have restrain&#x27;d the riots of your followers,
&#x27;Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end s*
As clears her from all blame.
Lear. My curses on her!
Regan.
O, sir, you are old; Nature in you stands on the very verge Of her confine: you should be ruled and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you
That to our sister you do make return;
Say you have wrong&#x27;d her, sir.
Lear.
Ask her forgiveness?
Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
[Kneeling] &#x27;Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;
Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg That you&#x27;ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed and food.&#x27;
Regan. Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
Return you to my sister.
Lear.
(Rising] Never Regan:
She hath abated me of half my train; Look&#x27;d black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart: All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
You taking airs, with lameness,

RONALD D. SCHOFIRLD
U.S.4. A rare experience of theater artistry was enjoyed by the audience in the Lobero Theater last night, when Alan Harkness and his wife, Mechthild ohannsen, presented their condensed version of
Shakespeare&#x27;s &#x22;King Lear.&#x22; .. so skillful was the selection and knitting to- gether of the lines, so artful the use of lighting, color, costumes, makeup, and simple setpieces on the barren stage, and so eloquent the vocal, physi- cal and choreographic communications, that one sensed the distilled essence of the drama, .. one could easily evoke the rude majesty of the kingly hall, the courtyard of the ducal palace, the stormswept heath, to lend a scenic frame for the
compelling figures of the two players. There was excitement and magic in the way they moved and gestured, their use of cloaks, flowing
draperies of rich, contrasting colors, and veils. Harkness played only the title role, unkempt, dis- traught and yet still commanding in his moments of rage and remorse. Miss Johannsen played the three daughters, by a simple device of veils of two colors, and the swift and complete change of voice, facial expression and inner character as one gave way to another. She also appeared as the motleyed Fool, capering and taunting and versifying, in tender solicitude for the mad old king. The ca- denced lines were spoken primarily for their dra- matic impact . . . there was richness and subtlety and nuance of expression that we experience far too rarely in the theater today. Miss Johannsen had a wide range of vocal color, timbre and pitch in her four roles. She was outstanding as the gentle and forthright Cordelia and the coldly ruthless Goneril. In. the tender scene where she seeks to soothe her father and restore him to his senses, she sang two lovely songs without words, to her own accompaniment on an old Irish harp, and re- vealed a voice of remarkable purity, range and
expressive beauty. Harkness&#x27;s characterization, in appearance and
movement and vocal expression was excellent. The production was a contribution of great aes. thetic and educational value, and at the same time compelling entertainment. It is to be hoped that this talented couple will be persuaded to give others of their &#x22;Great Moments From Shakes. peare&#x22; here for the enlightenment of young stu dents and the inspiration and enjoyment of the
general audience. ALAN HARKNESS

GABRIEL. MarcEL
Paris ... The other evening this shakespearean presence filled the theatre like a sublime breath. And with
what means! Not even rudimentary scenery. The effort to reconstruct by gesture, intonation and mime the soul of each of the four characters. In the incomparable scene, where Cordelia ministers to the distress of the demented king, accompany- ing her lullaby with the harp, she sang with the most pure voice I don&#x27;t know what melody per- fectly suited to the situation. Her partner gave all his stature to the personality of Lear; in the latter
scenes he simply took one&#x27;s breath away.
&#x27;ARTS
Catherine VALOgNe
Paris ...what actors! Impeccable diction delivered with a voice at once melodious and warm and adapted without effort to the dimensions of the theatre. A style of playing of exceptional class where the ges- ture is of rare beauty, breathtaking; a grandeur and simplicity of which one knows few examples in Paris. Ah! that Juliet interpreted by Mechthild
Johannsen; how moving and beautiful and pure! And Alan Harkness! it is all of Shakespeare reviv.
ing through him.
What fire in his acting, what flame where the rhythm of the verse recreated the emotion and the very life seemed renewed as by a miracle before your eyes. The miracle of one of the most beautiful texts ever, spoken by two great
actors, Mechthild Johannsen and Alan Harkness,
&#x27;NATIONAL ZEITUNG&#x27;
Switzerland With admiration one followed the splitsecond transformations of versatile Alan Harkness from Macbeth, vacillating between power-cravenness and conscience, to the bawdily cursing drunken Porter; from the nobly roguish elfking, Oberon to the pert woodsprite, Puck, who makes his wild leaps with incredible agility. Markness&#x27;s portrayal of Tachimo, whom he carefully deprived of any criminal intent and made appear as a vain inflated buffoon, showed his remarkable talent for the gro- tesque. Mechthild Johannsen appealed particularly as the graceful queen of elves, Titania. Her expres. sive gestures and singing, which rang pure as a bell and which she accompanied on the harp, lent a
special charm to her playing.
