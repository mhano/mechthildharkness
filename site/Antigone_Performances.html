Theater Here
Mechthild Johannsen, acclaimed
[&#x411;&#x443; critics as among today&#x27;s fore- most &#x22;one-woman theater&#x22; per- formers, will give her unusual in- terpretation of Sophocles&#x27; &#x22;Anti- gone&#x27; in the Players&#x27; Circle the Golden Bough Theater on Sat-
urday evening, Sept. 12. Miss Johannsen will be presented under the sponsorship of local
friends. In 1950 she toured Europe with her late husband, the distinguished actor and director, Alan Harkness, in &#x22;Great Moments from Shake. speare,&#x22; and before that took part in the Ojai Valley Theater produc- tions, including &#x22;Cricket on the Hearth,&#x22; and &#x22;Macbeth.&#x22; During recent months Miss Johannsen has toured Southern California with her current production of &#x22;Anti-
gone.&#x22; According to a critic for the La Jolla Journal, &#x22;few evenings in the theater have aroused the en- thusiasm which accompanied Miss Johannsen&#x27;s presentation of &#x27;An- tigone.&#x22; It was a rare opportunity to see the Greek drama performed in its entirety with a sensitive un- derstanding and masterly imper- sonation of each tragic character
by a superb actress.&#x22;

HARKN SSS The text used by Miss Johennsen is a Dudley Fitts and Robert Fitzgerald translation, its five scenes woven into an impressive tapestry by music of her ow and Leopold van der Pals&#x27; composition - performed with skill
and infinite grace on harp, flute, gong and kettle drum. With the altuation, that of a young girl caught between a law of the gods demanding that she perform funeral rites for her alain brother and the threat of death at the hands of her kingly uncle if she does so, seems long outmoded; nevertheless the underlying theme of the play and
the lines through which It unfolds are as timely as today&#x27;s newspaper. Miss fokennseh 1s not only an experienced actress, but one exceptionally
well equipped with beauty of voice and feature. Her interpretation of &#x27;Antigone&#x27; showed a rare depth of understanding and sensitive apprecia

In a world where all men are not equally free, the story of ANTIGONE, who preferred death to dishonour is

Her history begins with Oedipus, whose evil star so apparent at birth that his royal father, King Laios dad taus trot trust to Als nativd brought unknowing ore lag, court, origin. On the Journey he kills his father and after solving the riddle of the Sphinx that holds thrall over Thebes, he proclaimed King and given the widowed queen, locaste,

Four children spring from thl marriage: twosons, Eteocles and Polyneices and two daughters
Antigone and Issene.
When these horrors becone known, locaste hangs her- self and Oedipus puts out his own eyesight. He is later deposed from the throne by his sons and goes begging the roads with
Antigone to dio in Exile. The two sons agree to share in the rule of Thebes,
each to reign in alternate years.
But their fathers&#x27; curse,
which they incurred when deposing him,determines their fate. When Eteocles has ruled a full year he refuses to relinquish the throne to his brother. Polyneices then calls upon Argives
