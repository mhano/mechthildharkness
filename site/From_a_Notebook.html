													about the aims in our performances <br><br>
													<font size="2">To transform the everyday body so that it may move as
														the expression of soul and spirit.</font><br>
													<font size="2">To transform the everyday speech so that the sounds
														and rhythms of poetry become vocal and inevitable.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2">A word has its gesture.</font><br>
													<font size="2">A movement has its sound.</font><br>
													<font size="2">A true drama has its form which is
														gesture-movement-sound-word.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2">There are studies which lead to these inner dynamics.
														When achieved in a performance they make a strong impression on
														an audience, even if it does not understand the actual language
														of the speech. the deeper levels of the human being are touched,
														not only the head understanding and sentiment.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2">With such means one can more faithfully reveal the
														human tragi-comedy: awaken the emotions of the audience and in
														the Aristotelian sense bring harmony into these emotions.</font>
													<br>
													<font size="4"></font><br>
													<font size="2">We believe that the sustenance given to the
														audience-psyche by such a performance is of especial value in
														our age when so much coarsens and deadens it.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2">Above all our aims are to move to tears and laughter;
														to invoke by the magic of theatre the unsuspected angels and
														even demons; and by the sympathetic participation of the
														audience to bring about a transformation of human nature. If
														only one could achieve it and if one dared say it:-</font><br>

													<font face="Arial" size="2"> The qualities we look for in the
														student come under four main headings;<br><br>1. Actor&#39;s
														Fire - Temperament - Imagination<br>2. Psychological Truth and
														Characterisation<br>3. Bodily and Vocal Expressiveness and
														Plasticity<br>4. Possibility of Development - Flexibility and
														Openness to Suggestion.<br><br>Improvisations which call for
														strong emotion are useful. Here are some suggestions:-<br><br>a)
														On the edge of a cliff - the student sees someone dangerously
														near its edge - it seems inevitable that the person will be
														killed - the student rushes forward calling out to stop him.
														This can be done in various atmospheres - storm, sunshine etc
														and with various imaginary costumes.<br>b) A mother with her
														dying child. She is exhausted having tended to it for days and
														nights and now she waits, knowing nothing more can be
														done.<br>c) The man who comes home to his newly wed wife and
														finds her dead on the floor.<br>d) Walking about and speaking as
														different characters shows many qualities.<br>e) Asking some
														half dozen times &#39;What is the time?&#39; justifying not
														having heard the answer until about the 7th time calls forth
														inventiveness and a feeling of truth.</font>
													<font face="Arial" size="2"> f) We often ask the student to act his
														piece with a different Atmosphere - Idea - Quality - Tempo to
														judge flexibility. One or two phrases are often sufficient for
														this purpose.</font>

														<font size="2">(Lecture X The Mystery Character of D. Art)
														</font>
													</div><br>
													<font size="2">..... Let us seek the source of drama within the
														mystery-art, so that the seriousness of such a concept of drama
														may enter into our ordinary dramas and into the actions of our
														modern actors.</font> <br><br>
													<font size="2">In the costume we see represented how the gods work
														into human life. The course of such a drama portrayed events
														that occurred among the Gods showing how these events affected
														human life on earth. Everything on the stage was arranged so
														that the spectators had the feeling: the Gods themselves have
														descended to the stage with a part of their beings. This effect
														was created by the chorus which spoke in a manner between
														ordinary speech and singing, a special kind of recitative
														accompanied by instruments. By these means a style was evolved
														in sounds, syllables and sentence structures which lived before
														the audience in the musical plastic pictorial word. This special
														choral - chanting was capable of such variety and
														individualisation that the different Gods could sound forth as
														though incorporated.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2">Through such means the audience was able to
														experience what we call &#39;fear&#39; of the divine, awe and
														dread, but they also felt that in their moral life, within their
														souls, they dwellt among the Gods. These were the primary aims
														of the old mysteries.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2">But the ability to perceive anything at all within
														such an unnaturalistic stylisation gradually disappeared and man
														placed himself upon the stage, substituting his own form for the
														beings which could no longer be experienced through the musical
														plastic pictorial word.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2">Let us look at the Egyptian Gods - as a rule they
														were not adorned with insipid human faces but were given animal
														faces which represent permanence in contrast to the the ever
														changing human visage. The rest of their figures were human in
														form to show their evolving natures, but a human face cannot
														remain permanently immobile without becoming fixed and dead in
														expression. So the Gods were given the unchanging animal mask to
														represent their eternal qualities. Then we see how man - when he
														first placed himself upon the stage as an individual -
														representing the God as an individual - appeared with an animal
														like mask. Thus the art of acting grew out of the mysteries.
													</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2">......... Originaly man beheld the divine within
														nature in thunder and lightning in the clouds, but also in the
														impersonal sounding of the word through the chorus, but he felt
														within himself the Divine spark echoing the outer manifestation.
														He began to feel that when he represented his innermost being
														this was also something divine. Thus the representation of this
														inner spirituality evolved out of the drama of the Gods.</font>
													<br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2">....... Today the actor must learn to stylise his
														prose, and to carry his inner experiencs into the revellations
														of the outer world. It is not enough if he behaves himself as he
														would in ordinary life. One needn&#39;t go to the theatre to see
														that because life itself is even so much richer than the few
														meagre bits sifted out for the stage.<br><br></font>

															in the notebook</i>.</font><br><br>Exercises in Spiritual
													Development<br>
													<font size="2">(General</font>
													<font size="2">demands to which one must set or apply
														oneself)<br><br></font><b>
														<font size="2">First Exercise</font> - <font size="2">Control of
															Thinking</font>
													</b><br>
													<font size="2">The</font>
													<font size="2">first condition is the acquirement of a perfectly
														clear thinking. To this purpose one must - if only for a short
														time in the day, some five minutes, (the longer and oftener the
														better) free oneself from the will-o-wisp nature of thought. One
														must become master of one&#39;s thought world. Oine is not
														master if outer conditions, profession, some tradition, social
														conditions, yes even belonging to a certain race, if day and
														season determine one&#39;s thoughts and the carrying out of
														them. So, through this exercise one must, with wholly free will,
														empty the soul of the ordinary every day thought flow, and out
														of one&#39;s own initiative urge a thought into the centre of
														the soul. It need not be a dominant or interesting thought; what
														is to be attained in an occult respect is even better attained
														when one in the beginning endeavours to choose as uninteresting
														a thought as possible. Thereby the self-active force of the
														thought becomes more stimulated; while with an interesting
														thought the interest carries on the thought itself. One says to
														oneself: I start out with a thought (e.g. a pin) and link up
														with it, through my own initiative, all that which can
														reasonably be connected with it; through which fthe first
														thought is obliged always to remain alive before the soul. This
														exercise is to be pracised daily for a month. One can take a new
														thought daily or keep to the same one for several days. After
														each exercise one tries to bring to the full consciousness the
														inner feeling or firminess and security, which with subtle
														attention one will soon observe in the soul. One so concludes
														this exercise by thinking of one&#39;s head and the spinal chord
														down in the middle of the back, in such a way as if one would
														let each feeling of firmness pour into this part of the
														body.<br><br></font>
													<font size="2"><b>Second exercise - Control of Action</b></font><br>
													<font size="2">When one has exercised for about a month in this
														manner, a second demand steps in. One tries to invent any action
														which in the ordinary course of life up to the present has quite
														definitely not been taken up before. Now one performs this self
														chosen exercise as a duty every day. It is very good to choose
														an action which can be performed every day for as long a space
														of time as possible. Again it is better when one begins with an
														unimportant action to which one can, so to say, force oneself
														(e.g. one undertakes at a certain time of day everyday to water
														a plant, or look at the sky and the clouds in the same direction
														or to observe an object.) After a time a second such action
														should enter therein, after a time a third and so on, so manys
														as one can pursue with the maintainance of all one&#39;s duties.
														This exerise should again last a month but one shouldas much as
														one can during this second month also occupy oneself with the
														first month&#39;s exercise. But the second month&#39;s exercise
														should come first, and it must never be interrupted even for one
														day! All the same the first exercise and its effect must not be
														lost sight of, otherwise one will soon observe how the fruits of
														the first month are lost and the old backslide of
														&#39;uncontrollable thoughts&#39; begins again. Above all one
														must take care that these fruits, once won must not be lost
														again. If one has produced through the second exercise a
														such-like executed initiative-action, so will one, with subtle
														attention, become conscious of a feeling of an inner activity
														impulse within the soul and one will soon pour, as it were, this
														feeling so into one&#39;s body that one lets it stream from the
														head down into the heart.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2"><b>Third Exercise - Equanimity</b></font><br>
													<font size="2">In the third month, should be pushed into the centre
														of life, as a new exercise, the cultivation of a certain
														equanimity - as opposed to fluctuation between joy and sorrow,
														pleasure and pain; the exalting as high as heaven and grieving
														to death should with consciousness be replaced by an equable
														mood. One takes care that no joy runs away with one, no pain
														smites one to the ground, that no experience rends one with
														immoderate anger and vexation; no situation puts one out of
														countenance; that no expectation fills one either with
														anxiousness or joy and so on. One need not fear that such an
														exercise makes one empty and lacking in the fullness of life.
														One will rather observe much more in place of this that what
														proceeds from the exercise brings forth refined qualities. Above
														all one feels with subtle awareness one day, an inner peace;
														also one pours this subtle feeling into one&#39;s body in that
														one consciously lets it flow from the heart to the hands, feet
														and finally the head. This naturally cannot be taken after each
														single exercise for one has in truth not to do with one single
														exercise but with a continual awareness of one&#39;s inner life.
														But one must, at least once in the day, call before the soul
														this inner peace and then undertake the exercise of the
														streaming out from the head to the hands and feet.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2"><b>Fourth Exercise - Positiveness/Seeking Good</b>
													</font><br>
													<font size="2">In the fourth month one undertakes a new exercise
														which may be called Positiveness. This consists in seeking out
														continually the existing Good, Beautiful and Excellent in all
														experiences, natures and things. This quality in respect to the
														activity of the soul is best characterised by the Persian legend
														of Christ Jesus and the dead dog. If the esoteric student does
														this exercise he will soon observe that under cover of ugliness
														a hidden beauty exists; that even in a criminal lies veiled a
														hidden goodness, that in a lunatic somehow the divine lies
														hidden. This exercise is connected with that which one calls
														forbearance from criticism. Now, one must not comprehend it in
														such a way that one would call black white or white, black. But
														there is a difference between a judgement which proceeds merely
														from one&#39;s own personality and its sympathies and
														antipathies and a judgement which proceeds from the point of
														view of lovingly putting oneself in the place of a foreign being
														or stranger and without a single criticism, questioning oneself:
														How does this thing or being come to this, so to be or so to
														act? Then one comes to it gradually and quite of oneself to
														strive to help the imperfect instead of merely criicising,
														blaming or setting in order. The objection that life conditions
														of many people require them to criticise, blame or judge cannot
														be made here. There are, even many conditions present which make
														it impossible to carry out an occult training as here indicated,
														in any measure of fruitfulness. But here one should not
														impatiently wish all the same to make progress which can only be
														made under certain conditions. He who during a month can
														consciously place positivity in all his experiences will, little
														by little, observe a feeling in his inner being as if his skin
														were porous from all sides and his soul open itself to all
														secret and subtle events in the surroundings which before had
														completely escaped his notice. Therefore the point is to combat
														existing inattentiveness in man toward such subtle things. If
														one has filled this described feeling of the soul with a kind of
														beatitude then one so tries to draw his feeling towards the
														heart in thoughts and from there to let it stream into the eyes
														and out into space beyond and around the human being. Through
														this one grows, as it were, above one&#39;s self. One learns to
														observe a piece of one&#39;s surroundings as one observes a part
														of oneself that contains a quite intimate relation to the
														surroundings. A great deal of concentration is necessary for
														this exercise and above all things a recognition of the fact
														that all that is emotional, passionate and affected works
														destructively against the indicated mood.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2"><b>Fifth Exercise - Impartiality towards what Life
															gives</b></font><br>
													<font size="2">In the fifth month then one tries to cultivate in
														oneself the feeling of meeting in an entirely unprejudiced
														manner, every new phenomenon. The esoteric student must
														completely break with man&#39;s ordinary attitude toward what
														comes to his hearing or to an occurence about which he then
														says: &#39;I have never heard that or seen that; I heard
														otherwise; I do not believe it.&#39; The student must be ever
														ready to accept a perfectly new experience even when it
														contradicts his former experiences. For, all which hitherto he
														has recognised as legitimate; what till now has appeared to him
														as impossible - must not fetter him so that he be hindered in
														his reception of a new truth. The esoteric student must ever
														hold open the door for the belief that his hitherto existing
														knowledge can always experience a widening. He who in the fifth
														month is so minded to direct his attention on it will observe
														that a feeling creeps into his sould as is in that space which
														was spoken of in the previous exercise; something would come
														alive, as if something would stir in it. This feeling is
														extraordinarily fine and subtle. One must now try attentively to
														grasp this subtle vibration in the surroundings and let it, as
														it were, flow in through the skin in so far as the latter
														contains the sense of warmth. Less attention is applied at this
														stage towards impressions in the other senses, i.e. taste, smell
														etc, for it is at this stage of development not yet possible to
														distinguish the influences. Therefore the student leaves
														attention on taste, smell, etc to a later stage.</font><br>
													<font size="2"></font><br>
													<font size="2"><b>Sixth Exercise: Perseverance</b></font><br>
													<font size="2">In the sixth month one tries systematically in a
														regular alternation, again and again, to undertake all five
														exercises. Gradually through this a fine equilibrium of the soul
														is formed. One will especially observe that any existing
														discontent with the concerns or phenomena of the world will
														completely vanish. A propitiable mood arises in the soul in
														regard to all experiences. This is in no way an indifference. On
														the contrary the student qualifies essentially more than ever to
														function improvingly and progressively in the world. A quiet
														understanding unfolds itself for the things which earlier were
														completely shut off from the soul. Even the gait and gestures of
														a person alter under the influence of this exercise. And when,
														even, a person can observe one day that his handwriting has
														taken on another character then he may say that he is even now
														about to reach another stage on the forward path. Once again two
														things must be emphasised:</font><br>
													<font size="2">1) That this exercise has the power to paralyse the
														unfavourable so that only the positive remains present - and
													</font><br>
													<font size="2">2) That this attitude alone really assures positive
														success in Meditation and Concentration work.</font><br>
													<font size="2">The merely conscientious fulfillment of current
														morals does not satisfy the esoteric student, for these morals
														can be egoistic in so far as a person perhaps says to himself:
														&#39;I will be good so that I may be found good.&#39; The
														esoteric student does good, not because he wishes to be found
														good but because he knows little by little that Good alone
														brings forward the evolution of the world to its final goal and
														that against this the Bad, Unwise and Ugly place continually
														temporal hindrances in the path of evolution.</font><br>

														<div align="left">Notes on Pipwick (from studying engravings)
														</div>
														<div align="left">
															<font face="Arial" size="2">
																<font size="2">1. The characters are full of
																	temperament. They keep nothing inside but open
																	themselves in a lot of gestures, situations,
																	positions, etc. There is nothing restrained about
																	the characters or the situations. When a character
																	is restricted Dickens describes it as an exceptional
																	thing - ie the incident of the two restrained
																	gentlemen wherein one deliberately walked within the
																	eyes of the other.</font>
															</font>
															<font face="Arial"><br></font>
															<font face="Arial" size="2">
																<font size="2">2. In studying the engravings you will
																	see how the figures are expressing emotions. We must
																	act so that if the expression is to be shown on the
																	stage it must be shown with the whole body.</font>
															</font>
															<font face="Arial"><br></font>
															<font face="Arial" size="2">
																<font size="2">3. The manner in which they bow and do
																	everything is so particular - if you study the
																	engravings you will see what kind of movements must
																	be made. This will help you to wear the costumes in
																	the right manner.</font>
															</font>
															<font face="Arial"><br></font>
															<font face="Arial" size="2">
																<font size="2">4. One thing you must not take from the
																	engravings - the grimace.</font>
															</font>
															<font face="Arial"><br></font>
															<font face="Arial" size="2">
																<font size="2">5. Pay special attention to bridges and
																	transitions in the play. We must make everything
																	seem psychologically complicated - everything in
																	Dickens has been so compressed to such a point that
																	he looks at things through a microscope. In
																	imagining your characters imagine them as very
																	complicated - your acting must be the result of very
																	complicated work, although in the end we may do it
																	absolutely simply.</font>
															</font>
															<font face="Arial"><br></font>
															<font face="Arial" size="2">
																<font size="2">6. By studying the engravings you will
																	begin to feel that these people&#39;s lives are not
																	continuously flowing but are expressed by means of
																	bridges and transitions and points. Moving, stopping
																	and moving.</font>
															</font>
															<font face="Arial"><br></font>
															<font face="Arial" size="2">
																<font size="2">7. The settings will be slightly out of
																	perspective as suggested by the engravings - this
																	may also be true of the costumes.</font>
															</font>
															<font face="Arial"><br></font>
															<font face="Arial" size="2">
																<font size="2">8. There will also be an element of dust
																	about the costumes and settings so that they will
																	give an old appearance, although the colour will not
																	disappear. The audience must feel that it is a
																	&#39;tasty dish&#39;. </font>
															</font>
															<font face="Arial"><br></font>
															<font face="Arial" size="2">
																<font size="2">9. Do not look at the engravings from the
