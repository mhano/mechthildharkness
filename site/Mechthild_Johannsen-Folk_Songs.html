															FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 1948 Mechthild Johannsen Sings For
Appreciative Group At Hollow Hills It was a rare and beautiful experience to listen to the singing
of Mechthild Johannsen at Hollow Hills Farm last Sunday evening. She will be remembered as Mary Perrybingle in The Cricket on the
Hearth given here a few months ago by the Ojai Festival Players. In a simple program for St. Mark&#x27;s Day, she sang a group of folk songs, two lovely Bach arias and several compositions in the modern
mode. The folk songs were accompani- had all the magic of a fairy-tale,

Her choice of songs provid ed wide range of mood and melody, varying from the ancient Druidie number song &#x22;The Row&#x22;. giving biblical explanations of the numbers from one to tweive, to the more modern folk music of America portrayed in &#x22;Down

audience. In addition to her vocal talents, the artist is a composer of merit,
and she presented three poems,
&#x22;Folksong&#x22;, &#x22;Spring Grains&#x22; and &#x22;The Virgin&#x22; by Albert Steffen. which she has set in interesting musieal form. These were sung in the second portion of the pro- gram, in which she also included two ancient German songs, &#x22;Hymm To St. Michael&#x27;,
